# BCTcodes
This repository contains the MATLAB codes for the calculation of graph theory metrics. 
Metrics like global efficiency (Here GE), clustering coefficient (C), betweenness centrality (BC), and nodal efficiency (NE) are calculated. 
Note that BC and NE are the mean values of Yeo's 8 functional networks 
C is also the mean clustering of the entire brain network.
